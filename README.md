# WWE Practice Bios

## Description

Here, we have a practice page of WWE biographies, featuring four of the top wrestlers in the 1990s. I was motivated to create this page to practice and get more familiar with coding, and I wanted to make something I'm passionate about -- wrestling, particularly WWE in the 1990s. It solves the problem as to who is the greatest wrestler of all time -- you're welcome.
I learned that the console log randomizer names four different wrestlers as the greatest of all time. I also learned more of the git flow in terms of what to enter in command lines to set up a project and push changes in files.
